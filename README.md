Discourse is the 100% open source, next-generation discussion platform built for the next 10 years of the Internet.

Whenever you need ...

* a mailing list
* a forum to discuss something
* a chat room where you can type paragraphs

... consider Discourse.


## Getting Started

If you're interested in helping us develop Discourse, please start with our **[Discourse Vagrant Developer Guide](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/VAGRANT.md)**, which includes instructions to get up and running in a development environment using a virtual machine. It's the easiest way to hack on Discourse.

If you're familiar with how Rails works and are comfortable setting up your own environment, you can use our **[Discourse Advanced Developer Guide](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/DEVELOPER-ADVANCED.md)**

### Requirements

* PostgreSQL 9.1+
* Redis 2+

## Vision

This is the **Civilized Discourse Construction Kit**, a fully open-source package of forum software that is free to use and contribute to. Discourse embraces the changes that are necessary to evolve forum software, namely:

* A **flattened discussion**, which avoids the pains of threaded forums, and delivers a more robust, intuitive interface to join a conversation at any point.
* A **self-learning system**, capable of examining the behavior of the community, and adapting to budding moderators and forum trolls alike.
* A **seamless web-only** interface that delivers usability on both the desktop and the tablet, without the need for a native app.
* A **contemporary, robust technology stack**, so that both users and administrators alike have another choice BESIDES php.

The Discourse team wishes to **foster an active community of contributors**, all of whom commit to delivering this continued vision, and ensure that online discussions can grow and thrive in an Internet age dominated by micro-blogging and diminishing attention spans.

This vision translates to the following functional commitments:

1. Support all contemporary browsers on the desktop:
  * Internet Explorer 9.0, 10.0+
  * Firefox 16+
  * Google Chrome *infinite*
   
2. Supporting the latest generation of tablets:  
  * iPad 2+
  * Android 4.1+ on 7" and 10"
  * Windows 8

3. Deliver support for mobile/smartphones *as soon as possible*:
  * Windows Phone 8
  * iPhone 4+
  * Android 4.0+

## Expertise

Discourse implements a variety of open source tech. You may wish to familiarize yourself with the various components that Discourse is built on, in order to be an effective contributor:

### Languages/Frameworks

1. [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) - Our back end API is a Rails app. It responds to requests RESTfully and responds in JSON.
2. [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) - Our front end interface is an Ember.js app that communicates with the Rails API.

### Databases

1. [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) - Our main data store is Postgres.
2. [Redis](http://redis.io/) - We use Redis for our job queue, rate limiting, as a cache and for transient data.

### Ruby Gems

The complete list of Ruby Gems used by Discourse can be found in [SOFTWARE.md](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/SOFTWARE.md).

## Versioning

Discourse implements the Semantic Versioning guidelines.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.

## The Discourse Team

The Discourse code contributors can be found in [AUTHORS.MD](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/AUTHORS.md). For a complete list of the many individuals that contributed to the design and implementation of Discourse, please refer to the official website.
